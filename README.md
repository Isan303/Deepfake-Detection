# Deepfake-Detection
 🔍 Deep fakes are created by deep neural networks and can be nearly indistinguishable from real media.
 🌐 Deep fakes have both impressive and alarming implications, from creating world-class memes to spreading misinformation.
 🧠 MesoNet is a convolutional neural network designed to identify deep fakes and real media.
 🖼️ MesoNet is trained on a data set of extracted face images from existing deep fake videos.
 ⚙️ Understanding the data and its collection process is crucial for training machine learning models.
 🧪 The architecture of MesoNet consists of convolutional blocks and a fully connected hidden layer.
