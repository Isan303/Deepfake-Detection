# Deepfake-Detection
In this project, MesoNet is used for deepfake detection. Below is brief explnation of what MesoNet and Deepfake is and importance of this project.
    
   🔍 Deep fakes are created by deep neural networks and can be nearly indistinguishable from real media.
  
   🌐 Deep fakes have both impressive and alarming implications, from creating world-class memes to spreading misinformation.
 
   🧠 MesoNet is a convolutional neural network designed to identify deep fakes and real media.
 
   🖼️ MesoNet is trained on a data set of extracted face images from existing deep fake videos.
 
   ⚙️ Understanding the data and its collection process is crucial for training machine learning models.
 
   🧪 The architecture of MesoNet consists of convolutional blocks and a fully connected hidden layer.

To run this project simply clone the repo and then:
     
     pip install requirements.txt

After installing libraries just run the master_notebook.ipynb and the project will run.
